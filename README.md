# Error Learning

Welcome to the project "Faulty Memories, Favored Outcomes: How Errors Impact Learning Processes". In this project, we explore the differences in accuracies and reaction times between error-generation and study items in a task. Using behavioral data analysis, we aim to identify the underlying mechanisms of error learning and how it affects performance.

We have also built computational cognitive models with the ACT-R architecture that reflect different mechanisms of error learning. By comparing these models, we aim to determine which one best describes the phenomenon of error learning.
Using a Python adaptation of ACT-R we were able to create these models in an optimized environemnt. The fit of the two models was compared by estimating their log-likelihoods given the data. Thus, we were able to calculate the fit of each for each participant for each of their trials to comprehensively assess error learning.

Findings support a mediator method of error learning, where people recall their error on subsequent fact presentations and use it to retrieve the correct answer.

This project has the potential to shed light on the cognitive processes involved in error learning and can have implications for improving learning and training strategies. Thank you for your interest in our project.
