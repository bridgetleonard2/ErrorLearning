# Error Learning

Welcome to the project "Faulty Memories, Favored Outcomes: How Errors Impact Learning Processes". In this project, we explore the differences in accuracies and reaction times between error-generation and study items in a task. Using behavioral data analysis, we aim to identify the underlying mechanisms of error learning and how it affects performance.

We have also built computational cognitive models with the ACT-R architecture that reflect different mechanisms of error learning. By comparing these models, we aim to determine which one best describes the phenomenon of error learning.

This project has the potential to shed light on the cognitive processes involved in error learning and can have implications for improving learning and training strategies. Thank you for your interest in our project.
